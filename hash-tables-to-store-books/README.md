#Using a Hash Table and Hash Function to create a Book Information Database from CSV file

This repository contains Java classes that implements a Hash table (data structure) that serves as a book information database.

These Java classes apply theoretical Data Structures (Hash Tables) and Algorithms like a Hash Function.

This project demonstrates how to: Read in from a CSV file, Create a Book object with parameters, Create and use a Hash Table Object and use methods commonly associated with Hash Tables and Hash Functions.

The Book class creates a Book object containing a few parameters.

The HashTable class creates a Hash Table object that has a constructor and methods such as: hash, hashName, insert, printNumberOfNonEmptyEntries, sizeOfHashTable, sizeLongestLinkedList, updateISBN, findByTitle, find, loadNamesToSearchFor and loadBooksToHashTable.
