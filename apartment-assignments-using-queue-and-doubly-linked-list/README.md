#Assign and match students from queue to apartments in doubly linked list

This repository contains Java classes that match students from "InputStudentFile.txt" to apartments listed within "InputApartmentFile.txt"

These Java classes apply theoretical data structures such as doubly linked lists & queues and algorithms such as insertion, search, and removal.

This project demonstrates how to: read in from a file, create advanced objects, create and use linked lists, create queues using data from input files, and use methods commonly associated with queues such as enqueue, dequeue and isEmpty.

The Apartment class creates a doubly linked object containing a few parameters.

The ApartmentList class creates a linked list object that has a constructor and methods such as: isEmpty, findAndDelete, insertLast, insertFirst, loadApartmentsToList, linearSearchAndMatch and displayList.
This class uses Java libraries to load input from a .txt file to populate the linked list.

The Student class creates a queue object containing a few parameters.

The WaitingStudentQueue class creates a queue object with a head and tail.
The class has a constructor and methods such as: isEmpty, loadStudentstoQueue, enqueue, dequeue and displayList.
This class uses Java libraries to load input from a .txt file to populate the queue.
